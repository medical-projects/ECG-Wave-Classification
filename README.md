# ECG-Wave-Classification

The task was to build an algorithm for segmentation of wave types in ECG signal (a tool which they've solved previously) using their data set.
Unfortunately, the data they provided is licensed and hence I wasn't able to share a full working project, but I wanted to show how my solution looked and performed (see pictures). 
When I find some spare time, I will try to accommodate my solution to use a public data set (e.g. below).
